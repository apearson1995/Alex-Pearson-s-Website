I am very fortunate to have been raised by two elementary school teachers,
both of whom made sure that the importance of education was always emphasized.
Just like my parents, I take great pride and joy in teaching.

In high school I gave group and individual chess lessons to
local elementary school children, in undergrad I was a TA for
[CS 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory](TA'd https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70/su16/),
and during the Spring of 2018 I was a substitute teacher for the [Kern High
School District](https://www.kernhigh.org/). Below are a couple testimonials I
have received about my teaching (from course evaluations).

> Thank you for breaking down probability concepts to their basic level for me
> during HW Parties and your office hours!! Your explanations help me
> understand the basics so I can build up and understand more complicated
> concepts! <cite> **Student, UC Berkeley, CS 70** </cite>

> You explain things very well, thanks for being one of the best TAs I've ever
> had! <cite> **Student, UC Berkeley, CS 70** </cite>

This quarter (Fall 2018) I am a TA for Math 11A: Calculus with Applications.
