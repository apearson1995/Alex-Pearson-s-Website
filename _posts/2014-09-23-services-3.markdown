I am currently a first year graduate student at UC Santa Cruz studying
statistics.  In December 2017 I graduated from The University of California, Berkeley
with a double major in statistics and applied mathematics.  I completed my
honors thesis in statistics under [Prof. Rasmus Nielsen](http://www.nielsenlab.org/)
(The write up of my thesis is on my LinkedIn).

I have taken courses in data structures, machine learning, convex optimization,
linear algebra, numerical analysis, real analysis, and probability theory.
