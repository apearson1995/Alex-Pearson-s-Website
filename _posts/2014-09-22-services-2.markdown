I am fluent in python and R, and have a lot of experience with UNIX, Latex, and Markdown.  I also have some experience in HTML, Java, SQL, Matlab, and Mathematica.  A more complete description of my skills along with some projects I have completed in the past can be found on my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PqNBTQj5GVgY0eHebrMxdPRKgZeTPHuc/view?usp=sharing).
