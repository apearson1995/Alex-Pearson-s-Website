My full name is Alexander Manjit Pearson (but I go by Alex for short), and I am currently a second year MS student in the Statistical Sciences Department at UC Santa Cruz, expecting to graduate in June.  I enjoy spending time problem solving (usually Math, CS, or Stats related), teaching (I am currently a TA for Stat 5: Introduction to Statistics), and playing chess (although these days I usually only have time for [blitz games](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/blitz+chess)).

In December 2017 I graduated from The University of California, Berkeley with a BA in Applied Mathematics and a BA with honors in Statistics.  I hope to one day use my education to work on projects that blend biology, statistics, and computer science.  I am currently working with [Prof. Josh Stuart](https://jstuart.soe.ucsc.edu/) and the [Center for Cancer Genomics](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg)' Tumor Molecular Pathology Analysis Working Group to classify tumor subtypes.
