My full name is Alexander Manjit Pearson (but I go by Alex for short), and I
am currently a first year graduate student in the Applied Mathematics and Statistics
Department at UC Santa Cruz.  I enjoy spending time problem solving (usually Math, CS, or Stats related),
teaching (I am currently a TA for Math 11A:Calculus with Applications), and playing chess
(although these days I usually only have time for [blitz games](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/blitz+chess)).

If you have similar interests and want to meet up feel free to email me.  My
email address is [almpears@ucsc.edu](almpears@ucsc.edu).
