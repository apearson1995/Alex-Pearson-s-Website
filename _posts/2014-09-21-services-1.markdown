My full name is Alexander Manjit Pearson, but I go by Alex, and I am currently a second year MS student in the Statistical Sciences Department at UC Santa Cruz, expecting to graduate in June.  I enjoy spending time problem solving (usually Math, CS, or Stats related), teaching (I am currently a TA for Stat 5: Introduction to Statistics), and playing chess, although these days I usually only have time for [blitz games](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/blitz+chess).


In December 2017 I graduated from The University of California, Berkeley with a BA in Applied Mathematics and a BA with Honors in Statistics.  For my honors thesis I analyzed site frequency spectra generated from cancerous somatic mutations, under the direction of my advisor [Prof. Rasmus Nielsen](http://www.nielsenlab.org/).  I am currently working with [Prof. Josh Stuart](https://jstuart.soe.ucsc.edu/)  and his student Lucas Seninge from The Genomics Institute, to develop a novel bayesian method for annotating single cell ontologies.
