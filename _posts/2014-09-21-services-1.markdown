My full name is Alexander Manjit Pearson (but I go by Alex for short), and I
am currently a first year graduate student in the Applied Mathematics and Statistics
Department at UC Santa Cruz.  I enjoy spending time problem solving (usually Math, CS, or Stats related),
teaching (I am currently a TA for Math 11A:Calculus with Applications), and playing chess
(although these days I usually only have time for [blitz games](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/blitz+chess)).

In December 2017 I graduated from The University of California, Berkeley
with a double major in statistics and applied mathematics.  I completed my
honors thesis in statistics under [Prof. Rasmus Nielsen](http://www.nielsenlab.org/)
(The write up of my thesis is on my LinkedIn).

I have taken courses in data structures, machine learning, convex optimization,
linear algebra, numerical analysis, real analysis, and probability theory.  I hope to one day use my education to work on projects that blend mathematics, statistics,
and computer science.
